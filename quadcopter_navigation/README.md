# Quadcopter Navigation Package

Made by Rumaisa Abdulhai

## Description

This package launches the move_base and amcl nodes for path planning and localization, respectively. It also contains a configured rviz file for viewing the 2D navigation goal and the overlayed map while the drone is navigating to its destination or goal point.

**Note**: A linux machine running ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04 were used to make this package. This code is not guaranteed to work for other ROS versions, but many packages used in this project are available in other ROS distros.
